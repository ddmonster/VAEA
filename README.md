# VAEA
Visually Accessible E-commerce Assistant（VAEA）: the system is implemented based on the locally deployed llama2 major language model and speech recognition engine. Blind users can input interested products and product characteristics by voice, and this system generates the voice introduction of the products and displays them in the front-end.
